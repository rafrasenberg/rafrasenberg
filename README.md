# Hi, I am Raf Rasenberg 👋

### About me

Redeemed, husband, father, and versatile Software Engineer with close to a decade of industry experience.

I have a big passion for cloud, back-end, and anything DevOps related. Building infrastructure with IaC tools, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes and serverless, to name a few buzz words. Highly invested in the AWS ecosystem. Big fan of Terraform.

I focus on delivering high-quality (containerized) -and mostly serverless- software solutions, using clean code methods like TDD, in agile environments.

Aside from being a technical professional, I am someone that values collaboration, relationships and trust above all. Coming from a business background, non-technical communication and the ability to sell, are one of the key differentiating skills that set me apart from the more “traditional” engineer.

#### Core expertise
